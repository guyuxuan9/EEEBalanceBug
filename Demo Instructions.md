## ELEC50008-Engineering Design Project 2 – 2022-2023

### Instructions for demo assessment

Your robot will navigate and map a maze. A new maze layout will be set up for the demo and you won’t be able to survey it in advance. The maze walls are made from illuminated LED strips, and your rover must not cross the illuminated line while discovering the maze. 

Your robot must automatically explore the maze and your website or app must draw the map in real-time, overlaying the current position of the robot and the shortest path from the start to the finish (or to the rover, if the finish has not yet been reached).

You may place the LED beacons around the perimeter of the maze at the start of the demo. The beacons can be detected by the camera on the robot to triangulate its position on the arena.

The robot should complete the task while balancing on two wheels. However, this is a difficult task and you should ensure that the maze navigation demo also works with the support leg as a fallback. The provided chassis can be used with the support in the horizontal orientation, and it can balance in the horizontal or vertical orientations.

Your rover must be reliable and able to complete the tasks without human intervention. The robot must be robust and efficiently constructed. It also must be designed and coded for usability, testability, maintainability and scalability.

The demo will be preceded by an interview with the examiner. They will ask questions about your design and implementation, and you can demonstrate (quickly) any incomplete functionality that hasn’t been integrated into the arena demo.
