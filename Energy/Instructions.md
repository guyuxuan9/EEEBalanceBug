# EE2 Balancing Robot â€“ Energy System

## High Level Task Description
In order to map the maze, your robot will need some fixed points of reference to figure out its location in the 2D space of the maze. These fixed points of reference will be the three LED beacons we have provided to you, they are 1W LEDs inside a ping pong ball (for diffusion and to prevent you all blinding yourselves) which you may place anywhere around the arena.
The Energy System task is to provide power to these beacons from a PV panel (or emulated panel). As PV systems are variable in their output, you will need to manage the supply and demand at all times to make sure your system stays working. This will mean that you must be able to maintain function through (short) periods of minimal PV output.
