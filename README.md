# ELEC50008 - Engineering Design Project 2
## Project Brief: EEESegway
## Introduction

The Engineering Design Project 2 is one of the six modules that make up your second year of study. It brings together theoretical and practical content from your lectures and labs with important industrial skills relating to product design, project management and team working.

You will work in tutorial groups of 6 (2 EEE and 4 EIE) people to complete the project. It will be assessed with an interim interview, a final report, and a demo.

## Brief

You are requested to design and build a balancing robot (segway) that can autonomously map and navigate a maze. A prototype of the design must be built and tested in the artificial maze in the lab. The maze is laid out with light strips on an arena. The arena is coloured black and surrounded by black curtains.
